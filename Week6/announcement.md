**Subject:** Prep for Next Class: Docker, MongoDB, and Postman Installation

Hi Everyone,

For our upcoming class (Week 6), we will be diving into containerization with Docker. To ensure we can hit the ground running, **please install the following software BEFORE class**:

1.  **Docker Desktop**
    -   Required to run our containers.
    -   Download: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
    -   *Note: Ensure virtualization is enabled in your BIOS if you are on Windows.*

2.  **MongoDB Compass**
    -   A GUI to visualize our database data.
    -   Download: [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)

3.  **Postman**
    -   Essential for testing our API endpoints.
    -   Download: [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

We will be building a full-stack Pokemon application using these tools. See you there!

Best,
Jamie
