# Instructor Notes — PROG 2700 Week 1

## Delivery Plan
- **Total time:** ~35–40 minutes across two activities (each 15–20 minutes).
- **Cadence:** Type → Explain → Save → Refresh. Keep steps under 3 minutes.
- **Checkpoints:** After each step, ask students to show their screens or describe the change.

## Activity 1 — Key Talking Points
- Accessibility: Semantic regions (`header`, `main`, `footer`) help screen readers and navigation.
- Labels: `<label for="id">` links the label to the input for better focus and click targets.
- Validation: Show W3C validator, capture one error, fix together.
- Common issues in starter: duplicate `id`, missing `alt`, non‑button submit, excessive `<div>`s.

## Activity 2 — Key Talking Points
- Selectors: Attribute selector (`input[type=email]`) vs class selector (`.error`).
- Validation timing: **on blur** for immediate feedback vs **on submit** to avoid interrupting typing.
- Logic demo: Three variables, simple conditions, toggling classes.

## Wrap‑Up Prompts
- One readability improvement from A1.
- One selector gotcha from A2 (e.g., specificity or overly broad attribute selectors).
- Encourage committing changes and keeping a notes file for Friday’s lab.
